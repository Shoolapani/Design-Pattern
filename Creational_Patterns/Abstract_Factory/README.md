# 🚗🔧 Abstract Factory Design Pattern in C++ & Java 🚀🎉

Welcome to the world of **Abstract Factory Design Pattern in C++ & Java**! This source code exemplifies the powerful and flexible nature of this pattern in the context of car manufacturing.

## 📁 Source Code Overview

The provided C++ & Java source code demonstrates the implementation of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern to create cars with different types of doors and engines. Let's break down the key components:

### 🚪 Door Objects

- **`Door` Class:** An abstract class defining the interface for doors.
- **`GasCarDoor` Class:** Concrete implementation of the door for gas cars.
- **`ElectricCarDoor` Class:** Concrete implementation of the door for electric cars.

### 🔧 Engine Objects

- **`Engine` Class:** An abstract class defining the interface for engines.
- **`GasEngine` Class:** Concrete implementation of the engine for gas cars.
- **`ElectricEngine` Class:** Concrete implementation of the engine for electric cars.

### 🏭 Factories

- **`CarFactory` Class:** An abstract class defining the interface for car factories.
- **`GasCarFactory` Class:** Concrete factory for producing gas cars, implementing the `CarFactory` interface.
- **`ElectricCarFactory` Class:** Concrete factory for producing electric cars, also implementing the `CarFactory` interface.

### 🚗 Main Function

The `main` function acts as a client that interacts with the abstract factory and creates a car based on user input.
